# Java Basics: Variables, Data Types, Operators, and Conditional Statements

## Introduction

This section covers fundamental Java concepts, including variables, data types, operators, and conditional statements (`if-else`). It also includes exercises to reinforce learning.

## Topics Covered

### Variables & Data Types

- **Variables:** Containers for storing data values.
- Data Types:
    - **`int`:** Integer values (e.g., `10`, `-5`).
    - **`double`:** Decimal numbers (e.g., `10.5`, `-3.14`).
    - **`char`:** Single characters (e.g., `'A'`, `'b'`).
    - **`boolean`:** True/False values (`true`, `false`).
    - **`String`:** Sequence of characters (e.g., `"Hello"`).


### Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Relational Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators:** `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Assignment Operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`

### Conditional Statements

- **If-Else:** Used for decision-making.
```java
if (condition) {
    // Code executes if condition is true
} else {
    // Code executes if condition is false
}
```

### Exercise 6: Grade Calculation
Assign grades based on a given percentage.

### Exercise 7: Swap Two Numbers
Swap two numbers without using a third variable.

### Exercise 8: Leap Year Checker
Check whether a given year is a leap year.

### Exercise 9: Find the Average
Compute the average of three numbers.

### Exercise 10: Reverse a Number
Reverse the digits of a given number.

### Exercise 11: Circle Area and Circumference
Calculate the area and circumference of a circle given the radius.

## Conclusion

By completing these exercises, you have gained a fundamental understanding of variables, data types, operators, and conditional statements in Java. Keep practicing for mastery!
