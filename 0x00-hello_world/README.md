# Java Basics - Summary and Exercises

## Overview

This document summarizes the fundamental concepts of Java learned so far, including how to work with variables, the `print`, `println`, and `printf` methods, and how to apply them in exercises.

## Key Concepts Learned

1. Variables in Java

- Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated in your program.
- Basic variable types include:
    - `int` for integers (whole numbers).
    - `double` for floating-point numbers (decimal numbers).
    - `char` for single characters.
    - `String` for sequences of characters (text).

2. The `print`, `println`, and `printf` Methods

- `System.out.println()`: Prints text to the console and moves to a new line.
- `System.out.print()`: Prints text to the console without moving to a new line.
- `System.out.printf()`: Prints formatted text, which is useful when you need to control how variables are displayed (e.g., decimal places, string alignment).

## Exercises Completed

### Exercise 1: Using `println`

- Task: Print multiple lines of text using `System.out.println`.
- Example Output:
```markdown
Hello, Java!
Let's learn printing in Java.
Happy coding!
```

### Exercise 2: Using `print`

- Task: Print text in a single line using `System.out.print`.
- Example Output:
```markdown
Hello, Java! Let's learn printing in Java. Happy coding!
```

### Exercise 3: Mixing `print` and `println`

- Task: Mix `print` and `println` to create a multi-line output.
- Example Output:
```markdown
Java is fun.
Let's start coding.
Welcome to Java!
```

### Exercise 4: Using `printf` (Formatted Output)

- Task: Format output using `printf` for more control over data representation.
- Example Output:
```markdown
My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

### Exercise 5: Displaying a Table with `printf`

- Task: Print a table using `printf` to align the output properly.
- Example Output:
```markdown
-------------------------
| Name  | Age | Score  |
-------------------------
| Alice |  23 |    95 |
| Bob   |  27 |    88 |
| Eva   |  21 |    91 |
-------------------------
```

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Now that you've learned the basics of printing, variables, and formatted output in Java, you're ready to explore more advanced topics such as:
- Working with loops and conditionals (like `if-else` statements).
- Understanding arrays and collections.
- Learning about methods, classes, and objects (basic object-oriented programming concepts).
